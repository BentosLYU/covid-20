# Modeling and Control of a Campus COVID-19 Outbreak

This repository consists of a Jupyter/Python notebook for the interactive simulation of a COVID-19 outbreak in a campus-like environment using a standard SEIR epidemiological model. 

The following link opens the notebook for viewing. After it has opened, click ''Open in playground" right below the header to run the interactive simulation.

* [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ddb_0swsq9MRKyHrzflCzeF8Tqqmp24H)

Playground mode opens a copy of the notebook in a temporary session that doesn't save the notebook. If you wish to save any changes, select an option from the Google Colab ''File'' menu.
